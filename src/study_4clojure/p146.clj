;; 4Clojure Question 146
;;
;; <p>Because Clojure's <code>for</code> macro allows you to "walk" over multiple sequences in a nested fashion, it is excellent for transforming all sorts of sequences. If you don't want a sequence as your final output (say you want a map), you are often still best-off using <code>for</code>, because you can produce a sequence and feed it into a map, for example.</p>
;;
;; 
;;
;; <p>For this problem, your goal is to "flatten" a map of hashmaps. Each key in your output map should be the "path"<sup>1</sup> that you would have to take in the original map to get to a value, so for example <code>{1 {2 3}}</code> should result in <code>{[1 2] 3}</code>. You only need to flatten one level of maps: if one of the values is a map, just leave it alone.</p>
;;
;; 
;;
;; <p><sup>1</sup> That is, <code>(get-in original [k1 k2])</code> should be the same as <code>(get result [k1 k2])</code></p>
